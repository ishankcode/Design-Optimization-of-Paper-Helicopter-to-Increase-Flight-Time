Aim of the project was to improve the design of paper helicopters using experimental methods.

1. Identified Critical design factors, Using Plackett-Burma Design 36 paper helicopters (3 replications of the same design) were designed and their flight time was recorded when dropped from a height of 9 feet.

2. Used Half-Normal plots and Hamada-Wu to identify the best factors along with their setting levels to maximize the goal i.e. the flight time.

4. erformed validation study - Created a paper helicopter as per the design recommendation of the final model achieved from the Hamada-Wu analysis. The result achieved of 2.954 seconds was very close to the theoretical flight time of 2.9045 seconds.
